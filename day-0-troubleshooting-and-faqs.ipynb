To make it free, you can create a new project, do not set up billing (or remove it in the Cloud Console), and create the API key in that project.

ResourceExhausted: 429 Resource has been exhausted\n\nEach Gemini model on Google AI Studio has a dedicated per-minute quota. You can find the details for each model on the [Pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits). When you exceed this limit within a 60-second window, you may see a `ResourceExhausted` error.\n\n**Solution 0: Avoid Using Run All Cells**\n* Avoid using the Run all cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time.\n\n**Solution 1: Wait**\n* To fix it, you can wait up to 60 seconds and retry your request. Alternatively, you can try to switch to a different model (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash` or `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`).\n\n\n**Solution 2: Enable billing in Google AI Studio**\n\n* If you wish, you can enable billing to enable the paid tier of quota. Be sure to read the [pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing) to find out how much it costs, the [rate limits page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits) to see the limits, and the [billing page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/billing) for details on how to turn billing on or off. Note that billing is not required for this course, but if you wish to use higher quota, this is one way of doing so.\n\n**Solution 3: Use the free tier with Vertex AI Express Mode**\n\n* If you have never used Google Cloud before, you can sign up for an express mode account in a free tier to try Vertex AI for free for up to 90 days, within the specified quotas. You don't need to provide billing information to sign up in the free tier. You can upgrade to a paid tier by adding a billing account. Note that billing is not required for this course, but if you wish to use higher quota, this is one way of doing so.\n* To use Vertex AI Express Mode, [create an account](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/express-mode/overview), then create an API key, and use that API key for your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` secret. You will also need to set `export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE` in your code before running your agent. See documentation here: https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/models/#method-b-vertex-ai-express-mode\n\n**Solution 4: Use Vertex AI (with billing)**\n\n* If you have previously used Google Cloud, you can also use Gemini via Vertex AI. To do so, you will need to set different environment variables, as seen below or in the [ADK documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/models/#google-cloud-vertex-ai). Note that using Vertex AI with billing enabled means that calls to Gemini will be billed. Note that billing is not required for this course, but if you wish to use higher quota, this is one way of doing so.
